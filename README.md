## Description
This game is called Overworld Zombies. The objective is to survive as long as possible while zombies try to kill you. Zombies attack when they get too close, so shoot them down before they get to you.  

As you survive more levels, the zombies will generate faster and the game will become more difficult. Killing zombies increase your score, which is a good indication of how far you have gotten. If zombies attack you five times in a short time span, the game is over. Use obstacles and powerups to your advantage! The skull and bones powerup activates instakill which makes all zombies die froma. single bullet. The nuke powerup kills all zombies currently spawned.
